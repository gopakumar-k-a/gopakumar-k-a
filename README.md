## About Me

As a self-taught MERN stack developer, I began my journey by developing a variety of hands-on projects. My focus is on utilizing the MERN stack to build scalable and dynamic web applications. 

## Technical Expertise

I am proficient in:

- **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
- **React.js** for building responsive user interfaces
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for developing robust back-end services
- **MongoDB** and **SQL** for managing and querying databases
- **REST API** design and implementation

## Professional Journey

### Jersyman

I developed an e-commerce platform called **Jersyman** for selling sports jerseys using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project deepened my passion for creating seamless online experiences and enhanced my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities by integrating advanced features for security and user convenience.

### Used Market Zone

Another pivotal project in my career was **Used Market Zone**, a platform that combines social media features with a dynamic marketplace for pre-owned items. Users can list products for auction or post them for regular sale, enabling direct interactions and purchases through post replies. This dual approach enriches the user experience by incorporating competitive bidding and fosters community engagement through straightforward buying and selling.

## Looking Ahead

I am excited about contributing to groundbreaking projects and driving digital transformation. This is only the beginning, and I am eager to apply my skills and passion to shape the future of technology and achieve new milestones.
