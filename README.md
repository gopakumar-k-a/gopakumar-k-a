## Professional Journey

### Jersyman

### Used Market Zone

Another pivotal project in my career was **Used Market Zone**, a platform that combines social media features with a dynamic marketplace for pre-owned items. Users can list products for auction or post them for regular sale, enabling direct interactions and purchases through post replies. This dual approach enriches the user experience by incorporating competitive bidding and fosters community engagement through straightforward buying and selling.
